## Installation

[sentry2csv is available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sentry2csv/).

**pipx (reccomended)**

[pipx](https://pypi.org/project/pipx/) is a tool that allows you to install and run Python applications in isolated environments.

1. Install pipx, following their instructions
2. Install sentry2csv: `pipx install sentry2csv`

**pip**

Alternatively, you can install sentry2csv using standard pip.

1. `pip3 install sentry2csv`


## Use

1. Get a Sentry API Token from https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
2. Run the exporter: `sentry2csv --token <API_TOKEN> <SENTRY_ORG> <SENTRY_PROJECT>`
    * For example, `sentry2csv --token f9u3fdu821ed9j10sj19kjd991010 sparkmeter TopSecretProject13`

This also accepts an optional `--enrich` flag. Enrichments augment issues with data from the latest event.
An enrichment is in the form of `dotted.sentry.path=CSV_Field_Name`, and multiple enrichments are comma-separated.

The application will then fetch all issues of the according project and store 
it in a file named `<SENTRY_ORG>-<SENTRY_PROJECT>-export.csv` in the current working
directory.

Use `sentry2csv -h` to see all additional parameters.

## Development
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtualenv with Python 3.7 or greater
   * e.g., `mkvirtualenv -p $(which python3.7) sentry2csv`
3. Install the package in editable mode: `pip install -e .[dev]`
4. Hack away!
